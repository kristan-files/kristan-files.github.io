#Kristan Baggaley - Contemporary Landscape Painter

Kristan paints landscapes using oils and mixed media. The majority of Kristan's paintings are inspired by the Derbyshire Peak District close to his home. The work embodies the rugged beauty of the landscape and the vagueries of the ever changeing weather.
